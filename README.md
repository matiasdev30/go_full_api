# Go Full API

In this project I create an API in GO, for managing tasks in the database, with JWT authentication and authorization middleware.

## Installation

With Go already installed, run the command below in the project directory to download the dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Usage

You have a Makefile file configured, just run the commands listed and then access the documentation, or test using an API Client

```python
import foobar

# Creates API documentation and runs the API
make run

```
